# This file as a whole is managed there. DO NOT make edits here or they will

# The `dotfiles` repo is in /mnt/user/local

# Copy in our rc files
cp /boot/config/myvimrc /root/.vimrc

# Link the local array share to root data, useful for `cdd` alias

curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | FORCE=y sh | head
# Alternate idea?
#ln -s /mnt/user/local/bin/starship /usr/local/bin/starship
